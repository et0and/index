As creatives, we often rely on visual inspiration to inform our work. We collect images, videos, and
other media that resonate with us, and we use these collections to spark new ideas. But what if we
could visualize the spatial relationships between these images? What if we could see how they relate
to each other in a physical space?

This was the idea behind spatial.are.na, a project that visualizes the spatial relationships between
images on are.na. By mapping the connections between images in a 3D space, we can see how they are
related to each other in a more intuitive way. This allows us to explore our collections in a new
light and discover new connections between the images we have collected.

# Background

are.na is a platform for connecting ideas and building knowledge. Users can create collections of
media, and they can connect these collections to other collections through channels. This creates a
network of related ideas that can be explored and shared.

One of the key features of are.na is the ability to create connections between images. Users can
create links between images to show how they are related to each other. These connections can be
used to create visual narratives, explore themes, and discover new connections between images.

The spatial.are.na project takes this idea a step further by visualizing the spatial relationships
between images. It uses a 3D space to map the connections between images, allowing users to explore
their collections in a new way. Users can navigate the space, zoom in on individual images, and see
how they are related to each other.

# Implementation

The project utilizes the are.na API to fetch images and connections between them. The 3D
visualization is created using the
[react-force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/react-force-graph?tab=readme-ov-file) library,
which allows us to create interactive 3D visualizations of network data. We use this library to map
the connections between
